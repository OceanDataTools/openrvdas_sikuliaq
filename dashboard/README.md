# Grafana Live Dashboards

These dashboards rely on Grafana Live running, as well as an instance
of OpenRVDAS running the automatically-generated cruise definition file at
`sikuliaq/test/sample_grafana_live_cruise.yaml`.

They all assume that the machine name hasn't changed from `shp-openrvdas-test`, and that
the sensors haven't changed. If they have:
 - a new sample_grafana_live_cruise.yaml will have to be generated by running
   `utils/generate_grafana_cruise.py`
 - a new data dashboard will need to be generated by running
   `utils/generate_grafana_dashboard.py`
 - the `sikuliaq_all_in_one.json` dashboard will need to be edited to update
   data streams, etc.
