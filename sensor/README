DEPRECATED: This directory contains definitions that will be
loaded/used by the deprecated NMEAParser. It is recommended that you
instead use the RecordParser, as described in the [Record
Parsing](../docs/parsing.md) document.

======

A sensor.yaml definition contains:

name - name of sensor; typically also name of the corresponding logger

model - string matching the model name, defined in sensor_models/*.yaml

fields - Mapping from all the variables that this sensor can produce
         (from all message types) to the name that variable should
         have when coming from this sensor. If a variable is not
         included here (such as "Checksum", it is ignored and not mapped.

(Will eventually also contain sensor metadata: serial number,
installation date, location, calibration, test values, etc.)

Example:
{
    "name": "gyr1",
    "model": "Gyroscope",
    "fields": {
        "TrueHeading": "Gyro1TrueHeading",	
        "RateOfTurn": "Gyro1RateOfTurn"
	}
    }
}
