# The directories under lds/raw contains all data logged by the LDEO Data System(LDS).
# Many of the Sikuliaq's onboard set of sensors that output ASCII serial data such as 
# GPS navigation, gravity, weather and surface water properties is logged by LDS.
# LDS preceeds each line of serial data with the logger label and time stamp delimited 
# by tabs. But everything after the time stamp is generally straight from the 
# instrument unmodified with the few exceptions noted below. 
# 
# Many of the instruments on the Sikuliaq that output serial data will conform to the 
# NMEA 0183 standard. NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for 
# communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, 
# gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been 
# defined by, and is controlled by, the National Marine Electronics Association.
# The NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol that defines 
# how data are transmitted in a "sentence" from one "talker" to multiple "listeners" at a 
# time. Sensors that output NMEA sentences will be noted below. More detailed information
# on the meaning of the sentences can generally be looked up on the internet.
# 
# The following is a description of each of the individual sensors logged by LDS.

# flow_krohne_fwd:
#   
#   KROHNE OPTIFLUX 5000 Electromagnetic flowmeter measuring surface seawater flow being 
#   delivered to the forward TSG, SVP probe and Turner C6 in the bow thruster room. These 
#   electromagnetic flowmeters are designed exclusively to measure the flow and conductivity
#   of electrically conductive, liquid media. 
# 
#   The interface to this instrument is via Modbus RTU over RS485 so custom software had 
#   to be written to extract the required data from the sensor. The logged data format is 
#   unique to the Sikuliaq.
# 
#   Location: Forward seachest in Main Lab
#   Sample rate: 1 per second

#     The "C" poll is used to obtain routine data in NWS weather code format and detailed system 
#     diagnostic data. The accumulation is zeroed-out once every 24hours at 0 UTC.
# 
#     While underway this sensor always indicates that it is raining regardless of the weather
#     conditions. So usefulness of this data is probably rather limited until this issue is resolved.
# 
#  ** Sometime after sensors were mounted it appears they rotated about 45 degrees rendering the 
#     concept of "across" and "forward" meaningless.

# wind_gill_fwdmast_true:
# 
#   WindObserver 70/75 Ultrasonic Anemometer
#   Computed true wind speed. Uses SeaPath 320+ for reference heading source.
# 
#   Data format had been modified by LDS to use the NMEA standard for sentence 
#   MWD (Wind Direction & Speed).
# 
#   Model: 1390-75-B-313
#   Serial Number: 1351005 - WC45
#   Location: Forward mast
#   Sample rate: 1 per second
# 
#   Example data line:
#     wind_gill_fwdmast_true  2014-12-12T07:25:11.4542Z  $WIMWD,81.4,T,,M,6.9,N,3.6,M*43
